# Quark: Tiny prompt, massive ideas
## A jam with randomness
In 2019, I discovered this incredible project made by Brian Eno (a musical and artistic legend known for being the godfather of Ambient music, helping Talking Heads, David Bowie, DEVO, U2, Coldplay, etc. to create their most acclaimed releases) and a painter by the name of Peter Schmidt. It was apparently an index card set created to help creative "ruts" by giving you very (at times) abstract prompts to get your mind stirring of ideas with that unique limitation in mind. The name of the set? Oblique Strategies. I thought "wow that sounds so cool, what the fuck!", I used it right away, never looking back. In 2020 I read a book named "Visual Music" about Brian Eno's creative process. Going over how creative fields don't exist in a vacuum + how different disciplines drive and inspire others. How generative systems can be made to create art based on patterns found across all mediums, no matter how seemingly disparate.

In March of 2021, I made a P5.JS + Godot project based around compiling all of the cards out there of Oblique Strategies, across editions. Fast forward *another* year and a half, in 2023, I decided to say "y'know what, let me make my own card set!". That edition still being available at:
[Velvet Dice](https://raineivyaeera.github.io/raineland/Velvet%20Dice/velvetdice.html)

The version you see has my own creative cards + a bunch of other sections! Including Hex color generating, random emoji, textures to drive ideas (things like sturdy, gritty, dented), and the abstract "contrasts interpolate" category which gives you 2 extremes. But, in total, I was never really too happy with it. The cards felt overly self-indulgent in a way that didn't translate to other people, the textures were a waste, I never used the contrasts interpolate section, and overall the name was *stupid*.

So there were a few things that needed to happen when redoing this project. First off, redo the cards because they should be more personable and translate *clearly* while still maintaining my personality. Add textures that are more evocative, emotional, and get you thinking. As well as slimming this application down and really testing to see how it feels to use.

This time, it feels delighting, playful, and actually fun to use. The version I wanted all along.

## A Quark!
